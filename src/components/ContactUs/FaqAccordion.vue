              Paid Search Marketing works through an auction-based system.
              Advertisers bid on specific keywords, stating the maximum amount
              they are willing to pay for each click on their ad. The search
              engine then considers the bid amount, ad relevance, and other
              factors to determine which ads will be displayed
